        <p>Being sleepy, tired, or exhausted affects the driver both physiologically and psychologically. Driver fatigue weakens judgment on the road. Driversâ€™ ability to judge their own level of tiredness decreases, which is the most dangerous symptom of being tired.</p>
        
        <h2>Other Symptoms Could Vary Between Drivers:</h2>
        <ul class="symptoms-list">
            <li>Slow reactions</li>
            <li>Yawning</li>
            <li>Tired or sore eyes</li>
            <li>Restlessness</li>
            <li>Missing road signs</li>
            <li>Drowsiness</li>
            <li>Boredom</li>
            <li>Poor concentration</li>
            <li>Feeling irritable</li>
            <li>Making fewer and larger steering corrections</li>
            <li>Having difficulty in staying in the lane</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you notice any of the above symptoms, pull up to the side of the road. Rest. Refresh. Never drive under such conditions as it could lead to an accident. Never leave on a trip under the above conditions. Take a good rest the night before.</p>
