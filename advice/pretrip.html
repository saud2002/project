        <p>A 10-minute pre-trip check-up can pay off. The Car Care Council offers three suggestions for a traveler’s 10-minute pre-trip checklist:</p>
        
        <h2>Checklist:</h2>
        <ul class="checkup-tips">
            <li><strong>Check all fluids:</strong> There are several fluids, in addition to antifreeze, that require attention, including engine oil, power steering, brake and transmission fluids, and windshield washer solvent and antifreeze/coolant.</li>
            <li><strong>Check hoses and belts:</strong> A belt that fails can affect the electrical system, air conditioning, and power steering, as well as the cooling system. Cooling system hoses may be deteriorating from within, so old hoses and clamps in marginal condition might need to be replaced.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the tyres:</strong> Check tire inflation and inspect the tread for uneven wear, indicating the need for wheel alignment. Also, look for bulges and bald spots.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“While a last-minute checkup is better than no checkup, motorists should plan ahead to allow time to perform necessary maintenance themselves or at the local service facility. A properly maintained vehicle is safer and more dependable and will even save a few dollars at the gas pumps,” said the American Car Care Council’s Executive Director, Rich White.</p>

        <p>Not only can a pre-trip inspection help reduce chances of costly and possibly dangerous road trouble, it also provides an opportunity to have repairs made at home, with one’s own technician who knows the vehicle.</p>
