        <p>Establish road safety practices and routines in children at an early age as they are curious and want to explore. Protect and supervise children in all traffic situations.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Safety Tips:</h2>
        <ul class="safety-tips">
            <li>Talk with children about road safety in ways they would understand.</li>
            <li>Watch their movements and never leave them unattended, especially in the vicinity of a road.</li>
            <li>Young children depend on adults to keep them safe. Never leave a child alone in the car; this can prove dangerous as they can manipulate the car or, if no ventilation is present, suffocate.</li>
            <li>Children may also be restless and distract the driver while traveling in a vehicle. Ensure they are wearing seatbelts.</li>
            <li>They can be hard to see in traffic; therefore, hold their hand when walking on the road.</li>
            <li>Children may be easily distracted. They need help to understand what to watch out for and listen for.</li>
            <li>Injuries may be more severe than an adult's due to their smaller size.</li>
        </ul>
